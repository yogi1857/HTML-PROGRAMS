<h1> INDIA</h1>
<p>
<em>India is one of the developing countries of the world. The earliest civilization started here from Indus Valley Civilization in the north-west of India. India is rich in ancient cultural heritages available here. Researchers believe that India is the place where the earliest civilization has started. India is perhaps the only country in the world with so many festivals in a year. There is a festival on almost every day of the year.

India is the second-largest country as per the population after China. The Independence Day of India, The Republic Day of India and Gandhi Jayanti are the three national festivals of India. Our national anthem is our identity. We should respect it and sing with patriotism and pride.</em>
